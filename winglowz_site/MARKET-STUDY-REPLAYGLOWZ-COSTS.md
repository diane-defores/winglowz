### 2c. YouTube Transcript Extraction

| Method | Cost | Speed | Quality | Limits |
|--------|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **youtube-transcript-api (Python)** | $0 | Fast | Good (native captions) | No API key needed, scrapes public captions |
| **Apify scraper** | $0.001/transcript | Fast | Good | Hosted, managed |
| **YouTube Data API v3 captions** | Free (quota) | Fast | Good | 50 captions/day (200 units each) |
| **Supadata API** | 100 free/mo, then paid | Fast | Good | Multi-platform |

**Key insight:** Native YouTube captions are essentially free to extract. The Python library `youtube-transcript-api` scrapes them without using any YouTube API quota. ~70% of YouTube videos have auto-generated captions.

## 3. Cost Per User Model

### Assumptions (average active user)

- Watches/saves 20 videos/month
- Requests 10 transcripts/month
- Average video: 15 minutes
- 70% have YouTube native captions (free), 30% need AI transcription
- ~500 Convex function calls/month
- Uses real-time Convex subscriptions (~2 active/session)

### Cost per active user per month

| Cost Item | Calculation | $/user/mo |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Convex function calls | 500 calls (negligible in bulk) | $0.001 |
| Convex DB storage | ~5 MB/user | $0.001 |
| Convex egress | ~10 MB/user | $0.001 |
| Clerk auth | $0 under 50K, $0.02 after | $0.00-0.02 |
| YouTube captions (70%) | 7 × free | $0.00 |
| AI transcription (30%) | 3 videos × 15 min × $0.003 | **$0.135** |
| YouTube API quota | Negligible (list ops) | $0.00 |
| **TOTAL** | | **~$0.14/user/mo** |

### Cost at scale

| Users (active) | Convex | Clerk | AI Transcription | Total/mo | Per-user |
|----------------|--------|-------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| 100 | $0 (free) | $0 | $14 | **$14** | $0.14 |
| 1,000 | $0 (free) | $0 | $135 | **$135** | $0.14 |
| 5,000 | $25 | $0 | $675 | **$700** | $0.14 |
| 10,000 | $35 | $0 | $1,350 | **$1,385** | $0.14 |
| 50,000 | $135 | $0 | $6,750 | **$6,885** | $0.14 |
| 100,000 | $245 | $1,020 | $13,500 | **$14,765** | $0.15 |

**AI transcription is 90-97% of total costs.** Everything else is noise.

## 4. The Bankruptcy Scenarios

### Scenario A: Unlimited free tier with AI transcription
- 50K free users × 10 AI transcripts × 15 min × $0.003 = **$22,500/mo**
- Revenue: $0
- **BANKRUPT** in months

### Scenario B: Unlimited paid users, flat $7/mo
- 10K paid users × $7 = $70,000/mo revenue
- Top 10% power users (1K users × 50 transcripts × 15 min × $0.003) = $2,250/mo
- Normal users (9K × 10 transcripts × 15 min × $0.003) = $4,050/mo
- **Margin: 91%.** Safe.

### Scenario C: Heavy AI transcript users on $7 plan
- A user transcribes 200 videos/mo × 15 min × $0.003 = $9/mo
- They pay $7/mo. **You lose $2/user/mo.**
- If 5% of users are this heavy → still profitable overall, but risky at scale

### Scenario D: Free users on native captions only, AI = paid
- 50K free users × native captions only = **$0/mo**
- Paid users get AI transcription = **profitable**
- **SAFEST MODEL**

## 5. Recommended Pricing Structure

### The Golden Rule
> **Free tier = YouTube native captions only (zero cost).**
> **AI transcription = paid feature only.**
> **This single rule makes ReplayGlowz financially invincible.**

### Pricing tiers

| | Free | Pro | Power |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $0 | **$7/mo** | **$15/mo** |
| YouTube captions | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Unlimited | ✅ Unlimited |
| AI transcription | ❌ | 50 videos/mo (~12.5 hrs) | 200 videos/mo (~50 hrs) |
| Playlists | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Notes per video | 10 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Video saves | 50/mo | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Export (Obsidian, Notion) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| AI summary | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Priority support | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Revenue projections (conservative)

Assuming 2% free-to-paid conversion (industry standard for freemium SaaS):

| Month | Free Users | Paid Pro | Paid Power | MRR | Costs | Profit |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|-----|-------|--------|
| 3 | 500 | 10 | 0 | $70 | $14 | $56 |
| 6 | 2,000 | 40 | 5 | $355 | $50 | $305 |
| 12 | 5,000 | 100 | 15 | $925 | $125 | $800 |
| 18 | 10,000 | 200 | 40 | $2,000 | $250 | $1,750 |
| 24 | 25,000 | 500 | 100 | $5,000 | $600 | $4,400 |

**Break-even: ~Month 1.** The model is inherently profitable because free users cost nothing (native captions) and paid users' revenue far exceeds their AI transcription costs.

### Annual discount
- Pro: $7/mo or **$56/yr** (33% off)
- Power: $15/mo or **$120/yr** (33% off)

## 6. Cost Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate (implement now)
1. **Use GPT-4o Mini Audio ($0.003/min)** as default transcription — cheapest option with good quality
2. **Cache all transcripts** — never transcribe the same video twice across users
3. **Free tier = native captions only** — zero marginal cost
4. **Soft limits on AI transcription** — cap at plan limits, no overages

### At scale (>10K users)
1. **Transcript cache hit rate** — Popular videos will be transcribed once and served to all users. At 10K+ users, expect 40-60% cache hit rate, cutting AI costs nearly in half
2. **Self-hosted Whisper** — At ~5K+ paid users, a dedicated GPU instance ($200-400/mo) would reduce transcription costs by ~80% vs API
3. **Negotiate volume pricing** — Deepgram and AssemblyAI both offer volume discounts at 1K+ hours/month
4. **Use YouTube native captions first** — Always try free extraction before AI fallback (ReplayGlowz already does this)

### Transcript caching impact

| Active Users | Without Cache | With 50% Cache | Savings |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| 1,000 | $135/mo | $68/mo | 50% |
| 10,000 | $1,350/mo | $675/mo | 50% |
| 100,000 | $13,500/mo | $6,750/mo | 50% |

## 7. Updated Flowz Bundle Pricing (cross-product)

Based on this cost analysis, here's the complete product pricing:

| Product | Regular | Launch Discount | Type | Your cost/user |
|---------|---------|----------------|------|---------------|
| **WinGlowz Training** | ~~$97~~ | **$49** | One-time | ~$0 |
| **SocialFlow Lifetime** | ~~$149~~ | **$99** | One-time | ~$0 (local app) |
| **ReplayGlowz Pro** | $7/mo | — | Subscription | ~$0.14/mo |
| **ReplayGlowz Power** | $15/mo | — | Subscription | ~$0.50/mo |
| **Flowz Bundle** | ~~$246~~ | **$149** | Training + SocialFlow + 1yr ReplayGlowz Pro | ~$1.68/yr |

The bundle includes the two lifetime products ($49+$99=$148 value) plus 1 year of ReplayGlowz Pro ($84 value) = $232 value for $149. After year 1, ReplayGlowz renews at $7/mo.

---

## 8. Key Takeaways

1. **AI transcription is 95% of your costs.** Everything else (Convex, Clerk, YouTube API) is nearly free at any scale.

2. **The free tier must NOT include AI transcription.** This is the single most important pricing decision. Native YouTube captions are free — use them as your free tier feature.

3. **$7/mo Pro is perfectly sustainable.** Your cost per paid user is ~$0.14/mo. That's a 98% gross margin.

4. **Transcript caching is your superpower.** Popular videos get transcribed once and served to thousands of users. The more users you have, the cheaper per user it gets.

5. **You cannot go bankrupt with this model** as long as free = native captions only and AI transcription is gated behind payment.

6. **Competitors cluster at $8-10/mo.** Your $7/mo price slightly undercuts while being fully sustainable.

7. **No lifetime deal for ReplayGlowz.** The ongoing AI transcription costs make lifetime pricing dangerous. A heavy lifetime user could cost you $50+/year in transcription alone, forever.
