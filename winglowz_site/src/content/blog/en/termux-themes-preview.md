Changing themes in Termux is currently painful: long press on the background, "Style" menu, and a long list of names... **with zero preview**. You have to apply each theme blindly to see what it looks like.

We solved this problem. Here's an interactive previewer for all **114 themes** from the official Termux:Styling repository.

---

## Theme Previewer

Select a theme from the list to instantly see how it renders in a simulated terminal. Click **"Copy colors.properties"** to copy the full configuration.

**[Open the interactive previewer \u2192](/termux-themes)**

## Most popular themes

### Nord
Arctic palette with cool blue tones. Very pleasant for long coding sessions, with soft contrast that doesn't strain the eyes.

### Dracula
The classic purple/pink on dark background. Vivid and contrasted colors, perfect if you like a terminal that pops.

### Catppuccin
Available in 4 variants (Latte, Frapp\u00e9, Macchiato, Mocha), from lightest to darkest. Soft pastel colors, very trendy.

### Gruvbox
Warm retro tones with oranges and yellows. Available in dark and light, plus 6 Material variants with different contrast levels (hard, medium, soft).

### Tokyo Night
Inspired by Tokyo neons. Deep blues and soft purples. Available in Dark and Day versions.

### Solarized
The pioneer of terminal themes, created by Ethan Schoonover. Scientifically optimized palette for readability. Available in dark and light.

### Ros\u00e9 Pine
Elegant palette with rosy tones. Three variants: Ros\u00e9 Pine (dark), Moon (darker), Dawn (light).

## How to install a theme

### Method 1: Copy-paste (30 seconds)

1. Choose a theme in the previewer above
2. Click **"Copy colors.properties"**
3. In Termux, create the file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.termux
nano ~/.termux/colors.properties
# Paste the copied content, then Ctrl+X, Y, Enter
termux-reload-settings
```

### Method 2: Termux:Styling (app)

1. Install **Termux:Styling** from F-Droid
2. Long press on terminal > "Style"
3. Choose a theme (no preview, unfortunately)

### Method 3: Dotfiles (recommended)

Version your theme in your dotfiles and symlink it:

```bash
# In your dotfiles repo
mkdir -p dotfiles/termux
# Paste your theme into dotfiles/termux/colors.properties

# Symlink
ln -sf ~/dotfiles/termux/colors.properties ~/.termux/colors.properties
termux-reload-settings
```
