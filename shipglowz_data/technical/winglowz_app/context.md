# Technical Context — WinGlows

## Purpose

This context file is the technical governance anchor for `shipglowz_data`-based workflows and points to the current technical map in `shipglowz_data/technical/code-docs-map.md`.

## Owned Surfaces

- `shipglowz_data/technical/README.md` (governance index)
- `shipglowz_data/technical/code-docs-map.md` (primary route map)
- `lib/**` and `android/**` (code ownership source)
- `docs/technical/*.md` (legacy technical runbooks and module notes)
- `shipglowz_data/workflow/specs/*.md` (ready specs with migration and parity contracts)

## Invariants

- Flutter remains the target execution layer for this repo state.
- Android native overlays and IME behavior remain explicitly documented and are treated as platform-critical code paths.
- Firebase is the active remote adapter in the migration-ready state; Supabase/legacy paths are tracked as migration references.

## Validation

- `shipglowz_data/technical/code-docs-map.md` must be refreshed when major module boundaries change.
- `docs/technical/*.md` should remain discoverable from the map and preserve their frontmatter requirements.
- For changed code paths, generate a documentation update plan before closing implementation.

## Maintenance Rule

Re-run `/sf-docs technical audit` after architecture or platform boundary changes.
