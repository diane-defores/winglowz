# Payment Activation And Entitlements

## Purpose

This document is the reusable contract for paid access activation in the WinGlowz suite. It explains how a payment becomes product access, what Lemon Squeezy owns, what Convex owns, and what still needs a separate device-activation ledger.

## Vocabulary

- Payment provider: external system that collects money and emits signed events. Current direct-sale provider: Lemon Squeezy.
- Offer id: internal checkout id such as `winglowz_app/focus`.
- Product id: canonical suite product id such as `winglowz_app`.
- Plan id: internal entitlement plan such as `focus`, `power`, `control`, or `command`.
- Product entitlement: durable server-owned answer to "does this global user have access to this product?"
- Payment activation: turning a verified provider event into an active product entitlement.
- Device activation: registering one physical app installation/device against the active-device limit of a plan.

Payment activation and device activation are related but not the same system.

## Current Direct-Sale Offers

| Public plan | Offer id | Product id | Plan id | Active-device promise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Focus | `winglowz_app/focus` | `winglowz_app` | `focus` | 1 active device |
| Power | `winglowz_app/power` | `winglowz_app` | `power` | 2 active devices |
| Control | `winglowz_app/control` | `winglowz_app` | `control` | 5 active devices |
| Command | `winglowz_app/command` | `winglowz_app` | `command` | 10 active devices |

The Lifetime Deal grants access to present and future released WinGlowz platforms under the selected plan. The plan limit is the active-device count, not a per-platform SKU.

## Source Of Truth

Lemon Squeezy is never the runtime authorization store. It is a payment event source.

Convex is the durable suite entitlement store:

- `globalUsers`: canonical user identity.
- `identityAccounts`: provider account mappings.
- `productEntitlements`: active/refunded/revoked/pending product access.
- `productAccessEvents`: append-only access/payment/support event log.

The app and site may cache or mirror entitlement status for UX and sync eligibility, but protected access must fail closed when the suite entitlement cannot be verified.

## Checkout Authority

Product marketing authority and checkout infrastructure are separate concerns.

- Each product should keep its own canonical sales page on its own public domain when that domain exists.
- A shared suite checkout route is allowed and preferred when it reduces duplicated provider code and keeps product metadata explicit.
- Shared checkout infrastructure does not make `winglowz.com` the canonical marketing home for every suite product.
- The user should start the purchase flow from the product page for the product they are buying, then open the Lemon Squeezy hosted checkout or overlay for that exact offer.

Current application of this rule:

- `socialglowz.com/lifetime-deal` is the canonical SocialGlowz sales page.
- `winglowz.com/winglowz-founder` is the canonical WinGlowz App sales page.
- Both sales pages may call the same suite checkout route as long as the route receives an explicit `offerId` and preserves product-specific success, cancel, and entitlement metadata.

## Checkout Flow

1. The sales page links to `/api/commerce/checkout` with an explicit `offerId`.
2. The route rejects a missing or unknown `offerId`.
3. The route creates a Lemon Squeezy checkout through the REST API.
4. The checkout payload includes `checkout_data.custom` with:
   - `offer_id`
   - `offer_name`
   - `product_id`
   - `plan`
   - `source`
   - `source_ref`
   - `provider=lemonsqueezy`
   - optional `global_user_id` or identity metadata when available
5. When a launch coupon applies, the route may also send `checkout_data.discount_code`, for example `FOUNDER`.

Checkout success pages are not payment proof. They are UX only.

## Shared Endpoint Rule

One shared checkout endpoint is acceptable for multiple products when all of the following remain true:

- The request contains an explicit allowlisted `offerId`.
- The backend resolves the matching `productId`, `plan`, provider config, and redirect paths from the offer registry instead of trusting the client.
- Product analytics can still distinguish the origin surface through fields such as `source` and `source_ref`.
- Webhook fulfillment writes the canonical suite entitlement for the resolved product instead of a product-local duplicate ledger.

Do not create a separate checkout endpoint per domain unless a product requires materially different provider, auth, risk, or deployment behavior. Domain count alone is not a reason to split the endpoint.

## Webhook Fulfillment Flow

1. Lemon Squeezy sends a signed webhook to `/api/commerce/webhooks/lemon-squeezy`.
2. The route verifies the exact raw body with `X-Signature`.
3. `order_created` normalizes to `eventType=paid`.
4. `order_refunded` normalizes to `eventType=refunded`.
5. Unsupported, malformed, or incomplete signed events must become `pending_review` or `ignored`, never active access.
6. The route forwards normalized data to Convex `bridge:processCommerceEvent`.
7. Convex allowlists the product, offer, plan, environment, and idempotency key before writing.
8. A paid event creates or refreshes an active `productEntitlements` row only when it can resolve a verified global user.
9. A refund or revoke makes access non-granting without deleting identity.

## Identity Resolution

Automatic entitlement requires a resolvable suite identity. A provider event with only an email is not enough to merge accounts or grant access blindly.

Supported resolution paths:

- `global_user_id` supplied through trusted checkout metadata.
- Provider account already mapped in `identityAccounts`.
- Existing safe `sourceRef` correlation from prior access events.

If identity cannot be resolved, the event goes to `pending_review`; support must reconcile it manually.

## Device Activation Contract

The current entitlement ledger records the paid plan but does not yet enforce active-device counts. Device activation needs a separate implementation before the app can enforce 1/2/5/10 devices.

Required future model:

- A server-owned `productDeviceActivations` or equivalent table keyed by `globalUserId`, `productId`, `deviceFingerprintHash`, `platform`, `status`, `activatedAt`, `lastSeenAt`, and `deactivatedAt`.
- Plan-to-limit mapping: `focus=1`, `power=2`, `control=5`, `command=10`.
- Device identifiers must be privacy-preserving and revocable; do not store raw hardware identifiers when a stable hashed app installation id is enough.
- Same-device reactivation must be idempotent.
- New activation over plan limit must fail closed with a recoverable "deactivate another device" path.
- Refund/revoke/expired entitlement makes all related device activations non-granting for access checks.

Until this exists, the public page may describe active-device limits as the commercial plan rule, but the app must not claim that automatic device enforcement is complete.

## Support Runbook

Support must be able to:

- Find an order by Lemon Squeezy order id, customer id, checkout id, or redacted buyer email.
- Find the matching `productAccessEvents` row by provider idempotency key or `sourceRef`.
- Verify whether a `productEntitlements` row exists for `productId=winglowz_app`.
- See `plan`, `status`, `source`, `sourceRef`, `environment`, and update time without exposing secrets.
- Manually grant, revoke, or mark pending-review cases with an append-only event.
- Reconcile wrong-account purchases without silent email-only merges.
- Document refund/revoke effects before answering support.

Never paste raw webhook payloads, API keys, signatures, cookies, raw activation codes, or full customer PII into support notes.

## Proof Checklist

Local proof:

- Commerce offer registry tests cover all founder offers.
- Checkout route tests reject missing/unknown offers and create Lemon Squeezy checkouts with correct metadata.
- Lemon Squeezy adapter tests verify `checkout_data.custom`, `discount_code`, signed webhook parsing, paid/refund normalization, and idempotency key shape.
- Webhook route tests verify all four WinGlowz plans are forwarded to `bridge:processCommerceEvent`.

Hosted provider proof:

- Create a Lemon Squeezy test-mode checkout for a WinGlowz founder plan.
- Complete a test order.
- Confirm the signed webhook reaches production/preview.
- Confirm Convex writes a `productAccessEvents` entry and active `productEntitlements` row.
- Replay the same webhook and confirm idempotent behavior.
- Refund the test order or simulate a signed refund event.
- Confirm the entitlement becomes non-granting.

Launch status is not "ready to sell broadly" until hosted provider proof passes or Diane explicitly accepts manual fulfillment risk.
