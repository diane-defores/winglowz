# Blog And Article Surface Policy

## Purpose

Keep blog and article recommendations aligned with the current WinGlows public-content model.

## Surface Rules

- `src/content/blog/{en,fr}/` is the canonical public article surface.
- `src/content/docs/{en,fr}/` is the canonical structured learning surface.
- Draft source notes remain in `CONTENU/` until promoted intentionally.

## Editorial Rules

- Use blog posts for discovery, qualification, and educational entry points.
- Use docs for structured learning, premium teaching, and curriculum depth.
- Do not publish tool dumps or unsupported promise copy.
- Keep English and French publishing aligned on commercially important topics.

## Surface Missing

- If a requested article surface does not exist, report `surface missing: blog`.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this policy when article publishing paths or roles change.
