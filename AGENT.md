# AGENT

## Purpose

This repository is the canonical WinGlowz monorepo for the Astro site and Flutter app.

## Repository Layout

- `winglowz_site/`: Astro site with content, account, commerce, Convex, and bridge API surfaces.
- `winglowz_app/`: Flutter Android-first app with Firebase, native Android IME work, and app-level docs.
- `shipglowz_data/`: monorepo-level governance, specs, bugs, audits, and workflow artifacts.

## Working Rules

- Treat `shipglowz_data/` at the repository root as the only canonical governance corpus.
- Keep subproject changes inside their subproject unless root CI, docs, or governance files must change.
- Preserve public content language rules in the site and app docs; user-facing French should remain natural and accented.
- Do not add secrets to root or subproject docs, workflows, or env examples.
- Do not use the sibling `/home/claude/winglowz_app` checkout as an active source after this monorepo is verified.

## Validation

Use focused checks from the changed subproject:

```bash
(cd winglowz_site && pnpm build:check)
(cd winglowz_site && pnpm test:unit)
(cd winglowz_app && flutter analyze)
(cd winglowz_app && flutter test)
```

Run ShipGlowz metadata validation for governance docs when governance files change:

```bash
/home/claude/shipglowz/tools/shipglowz_metadata_lint.py AGENT.md shipglowz_data
```
