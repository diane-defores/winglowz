# Agent Guide

## Mission

WinFlowz is a bilingual Astro application for Windows-focused productivity content, products, docs, and training sales. The repo combines:

- marketing and editorial pages
- gated training purchase flows
- Clerk authentication
- Convex-backed user and feature data
- Polar checkout and webhook handling
- Resend newsletter flows

## First Places to Read

1. `CLAUDE.md` for the local MCP/context workflow expected in this repo.
2. `shipflow_data/technical/guidelines.md` for product and routing constraints.
3. `shipflow_data/technical/architecture.md` for system boundaries and runtime flows.
4. `shipflow_data/technical/context.md` for a concise directory and feature map.

## Stack Summary

- Frontend: Astro 6, Tailwind, MDX, React islands
- Deployment: Vercel server output
- Auth: Clerk middleware and webhook sync
- Data: Convex schema, queries, mutations, HTTP actions
- Billing: Polar checkout route plus Convex webhook processing
- Email: Resend subscription and unsubscribe endpoints
- Content: Astro content collections for docs, blog, products, services

## Critical Working Rules

- Keep English routes unprefixed and French routes under `/fr`.
- Preserve route translation integrity between `src/pages/[...lang]`, `src/i18n/*`, and routing helpers.
- Treat `src/pages/api/polar/checkout.ts` and `convex/http.ts` as a coupled purchase flow.
- Treat Clerk webhook sync and Convex user records as a coupled identity flow.
- Do not document or introduce dead-end commerce CTAs.
- If changing content schemas, update `src/content/config.ts` and audit affected content folders.

## High-Risk Areas

- `src/middleware/i18n.ts`: route canonicalization and locale redirects
- `src/pages/api/polar/checkout.ts`: auth, env validation, checkout creation
- `convex/http.ts`: webhook verification and entitlement updates
- `src/pages/api/newsletter/*.ts`: external email audience side effects
- `convex/schema.ts`: persistent data contract

## Environment Assumptions

The codebase expects valid values for Clerk, Convex, Polar, and Resend. Placeholder env values are explicitly rejected in parts of the runtime, especially checkout and newsletter flows.

## Change Checklist

1. If you change routing, inspect `src/utils/routing.ts`, `src/middleware/i18n.ts`, and `src/i18n/*`.
2. If you change checkout or entitlements, inspect `src/utils/courseGating.ts`, `src/pages/api/polar/*`, and `convex/polar.ts`.
3. If you change auth lifecycle behavior, inspect `src/pages/api/clerk/webhook.ts`, `convex/http.ts`, and `convex/users.ts`.
4. If you change docs or content model behavior, inspect `src/content/config.ts` and the relevant content folders.

## Entry Surface

- Public routes: `src/pages/[...lang]/*`
- Dashboard routes: `src/pages/dashboard/*`
- API routes: `src/pages/api/*`
- Backend actions and data: `convex/*`

## Current Confidence

High for technical boundaries and runtime flow mapping because all claims above are directly grounded in current repo files and route handlers.
