# Android Overlay — WinGlowz

## Contract

This document describes the Android host for the WinGlowz overlay capability.
The Android implementation is Android-only: foreground service, `WindowManager`
bubble, Android accessibility delivery, and Android permissions must not be
represented as available on iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, or web.

The overlay product concept is broader than Android. Windows now has a separate
desktop overlay/hotkeys chantier: it should reuse the shared Flutter product UI
and actions, but implement hotkeys, always-on-top window behavior, focus,
clipboard, and text delivery through a Windows-native host rather than porting
the Kotlin service.

This same principle should apply to the rest of the platform roadmap: concepts
such as overlay/quick actions, voice, snippets, dictionary, clipboard, local
history and sync are parity targets by default. Android-only language in this
document refers to Android system mechanisms, not to the product concept.

WinGlowz keyboard is now the preferred Android text-entry surface for in-field typing, dictation, clipboard actions, snippets entry points, and generic media play/pause. Overlay remains complementary for floating capture flows and fallback delivery, not the primary keyboard path.

The Flutter port now owns an actual native overlay bubble through `OverlayForegroundService`, `OverlayView`, `WaveformView`, `OverlayEventQueue`, and `OverlayTextInjectionHelper`. The old Expo module remains a legacy reference only and must not be used at runtime.

## Permissions

- Overlay permission is required before showing the bubble.
- Microphone permission is required before recording.
- Accessibility permission is optional and required only for direct text injection.
- The app must explain accessibility use plainly: it injects final text into the focused editable field when the user explicitly starts dictation.

## Runtime Rules

- The visible overlay bubble runs as a user-controlled Android foreground service with `specialUse`; it must not require microphone runtime permission merely to appear.
- Starting recording from overlay requires an explicit user action.
- A foreground notification is visible while the overlay service is active.
- Stop and cancel are always available.
- The collapsed bubble can be dragged to reposition it; expanded recording controls expose a dedicated drag handle so stop/cancel taps stay reliable.
- If no editable field is focused, injection is skipped and final text is copied to clipboard.
- If the focused field appears sensitive/password-like where detectable, injection is skipped and clipboard copy is disabled for that result.
- Rapid tap/stop/cancel events are debounced and cannot start concurrent recordings.
- Service cleanup must run on app logout, permission revoke, crash recovery, and app shutdown where the platform allows.

If both overlay and IME attempt to start recording at the same time, the second surface is rejected through the shared microphone-session coordinator.

## Flutter Bridge (MethodChannel `winglowz_app/overlay`)

- `getOverlayStatus`: returns `enabled`, `requestedEnabled`, `running`, `overlayPermissionGranted`, `accessibilityPermissionGranted`, `deliveryMode`.
- `setOverlayEnabled`: enables/disables overlay runtime capability.
- `startOverlayRecording`, `stopOverlayRecording`, `cancelOverlayRecording`: foreground service controls with idempotent stop/cancel and guarded start.
- `drainOverlayEvents`: returns queued native overlay events such as `bubbleTap`, `longPress`, `recordStop`, `recordCancel`, and `serviceError`.
- `drainOverlayEvents` also delivers `overlayTextDelivery` events with a validated final transcription payload (`rawText`, `cleanedText`, `language`, `source`, `durationMs`) and `delivery` metadata (`injected`, `clipboardCopied`, `sensitiveField`, `deliveryPolicy`), which are persisted in Flutter as `source=overlay` transcriptions.
- `setOverlayState`, `updateMeterLevel`, `setResultText`: lets Flutter mirror voice pipeline state into the native bubble.
- `deliverText`: attempts accessibility injection with explicit policy and only copies to clipboard when the policy allows it.

`deliverText` now returns the current delivery policy (`clipboard_only` or `injection_and_clipboard`) so Flutter can report when a text delivery was blocked by sensitive target detection.
- `openOverlayPermissionSettings`, `openAccessibilitySettings`: deep-links to Android settings recovery paths.

`deliveryMode` is `clipboard_only` when accessibility is disabled, and `injection_and_clipboard` when enabled.

## Keyboard Relationship

- The IME uses Android `InputConnection` for insertion and must not use accessibility as its primary injection mechanism.
- Overlay and IME recording paths must not run concurrent active recordings. The current IME foundation uses native Android speech recognition; a shared recording coordinator is still required before claiming full overlay/app/keyboard voice-session arbitration.
- Sensitive field detection rules must stay aligned between overlay injection and IME private mode wherever Android exposes comparable signals.

## Fallback

Clipboard fallback is required for every successful overlay transcription. Direct injection is a best-effort enhancement, not the only delivery path.

`deliverText` returns whether text was injected, copied to clipboard, and blocked by a sensitive field. It must not log text content.

## Legacy Reference

Keep `modules/floating-overlay/` and `winglowz_app_snapshots/winglowz_app-pre-flutter-migration-20260427-081046.tar.gz` until a real Android QA pass confirms parity. Cleanup belongs in a separate chantier after proof.

## Required Tests

- Permission denied for overlay, microphone, and accessibility.
- No focused field.
- Non-editable field.
- Sensitive/password-like field where detectable.
- Locked screen/background transition.
- Rapid start/stop/cancel race.
- App logout while overlay is active.
- Android build with service and accessibility declarations.
- WinGlowz keyboard appears in Android input method settings and can type in a standard text field.
