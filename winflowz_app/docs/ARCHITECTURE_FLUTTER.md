# Architecture Flutter — WinFlowz

## Runtime Layout

- `lib/main.dart` bootstraps Supabase from `--dart-define` and starts Riverpod.
- `lib/app/winflowz_app.dart` configures MaterialApp + router + theme.
- `lib/core/*` holds shared bootstrap, routing, theme and platform capability checks.
- `lib/features/*` holds product domains (auth, voice, clipboard, settings, shell).
- `lib/data/supabase/*` holds Supabase client wiring and repositories.
- `supabase/migrations/*` is the source of truth for schema + RLS + constraints.

## Security Rules in Code

- No service role key in client code.
- Supabase starts only with publishable key + project URL from runtime defines.
- BYOK keys are written to local secure storage facade and never synced.
- Linux and web are treated as secure-storage degraded contexts.
- Platform behavior and overlay availability are shown in UI as explicit capability state.

## Migration Status

- Flutter multi-platform project scaffold is created for Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux and web.
- Supabase baseline migration is created with user-scoped tables, constraints and RLS policies.
- Legacy Expo/Convex application code has been removed from source; legacy references remain in docs only for parity and migration context.

## Next Execution Slice

1. Validate Supabase repositories against a real Auth/RLS environment.
2. Implement real voice pipeline services (local speech, recording, Whisper, Claude fallback).
3. Port Android native overlay to Flutter platform channel.
4. Execute verification matrix from `docs/VERIFICATION.md`.
5. Run purge gate only after parity checks pass.
