# Decisions — WinFlowz

## 2026-05-19 — Suite identity exception for Clerk (reviewed)

### Decision

The "Clerk is legacy" rule applies only to direct target implementation inside the WinFlowz Android app repo. It does not forbid Clerk as the suite identity provider.

Current identity split:

1. Clerk is the long-term central identity provider for the WinFlowz suite and the WinFlowz Formation web/account surface.
2. Firebase Auth remains the WinFlowz Android app auth adapter for now.
3. A server-owned bridge maps Firebase `uid` and Clerk user id to `global_user_id`.
4. Product access is controlled by server-owned entitlements, not by account existence.

### Consequences

- Do not migrate the Android app directly to Clerk Flutter/native until Android device QA proves that path.
- Do not treat the old Expo/Convex/Clerk app stack as the Android target.
- Do treat Clerk as active suite identity context when working on `unified-suite-authentication`.
- Keep `winflowz_app` product data behind backend-neutral stores and Firebase/Firestore adapter boundaries until a later spec changes that.

## 2026-05-09 — Backend abstraction and Android-first execution (reviewed)

### Decision

WinFlowz no longer treats Supabase as the active backend target. The app must move to backend-agnostic data/settings contracts with Firebase as the first hosted adapter for the Android MVP.

1. Backend-facing Flutter code must use provider-neutral contracts such as settings, clipboard, transcription, snippets, dictionary and auth stores.
2. Firebase Auth + Firestore is the first remote adapter candidate for the Android MVP because it has a free Spark plan, does not use Supabase-style project pausing, supports Flutter/Android well, and is deployable through CLI-managed rules/indexes.
3. Supabase remains a migration artifact and reference only until removed or replaced. Do not add new Supabase-coupled product code.
4. GitHub Secrets remain the CI secret source for Android builds on Blacksmith.
5. Current implementation focus is Android. Web and non-Android cloud-AI behavior are ignored for now unless a later reviewed decision reopens them.
6. The proprietary Android keyboard implementation proceeds progressively: base typing and safety first, advanced gestures/modularity after the first usable keyboard slice.

### Consequences

- Existing Supabase SQL, docs and repositories are legacy/current-state material, not the future coupling point.
- New sync/settings work should introduce backend-neutral interfaces before adding Firebase implementation.
- Documentation that says "Flutter + Supabase target" is stale after this decision and must be updated as touched.
- Live backend validation waits until Firebase project/rules/indexes are created through CLI workflow.

## 2026-04-27 — Implementation target lock (reviewed)

Superseded in part by the 2026-05-09 backend decision above. Flutter remains valid. Supabase is no longer the active backend target and is now a migration/reference artifact.

### Decision

WinFlowz implementation target is now explicit and binding:

1. Client application target: **Flutter** (single Dart codebase).
2. Backend target: **Supabase** (Auth + Postgres + RLS + Realtime).
3. Day 1 platform target: **Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, web**.
4. Android overlay remains native Kotlin, exposed to Flutter through plugin/platform-channel contracts.
5. Convex, Clerk, Expo/React Native are **legacy references only** for the old app implementation during migration and are not valid direct Android app target architecture choices.

### Current stance

- This replaces the prior directional (non-committal) platform note.
- This decision is reviewed and ready for execution workstreams.
- Any implementation or doc that presents the old Convex/Clerk/Expo app stack as the Android app target is out of date. Clerk remains valid as the suite identity provider under the 2026-05-19 decision.

### Rationale

- The migration spec (`docs/SPEC_FLUTTER_SUPABASE_MIGRATION.md`) requires a repo end-state without app-level JS/TS implementation.
- Supabase provides first-class Flutter support and a clear contract for auth isolation with `auth.uid()` + RLS.
- Product scope requires synchronized multi-platform state, but only Android needs system overlay behavior.

### Consequences

- Architecture, API, component, and guideline docs must split legacy reference from target contracts.
- Backend contracts move from Convex function signatures to Supabase schema/policies/realtime contracts.
- Legacy stack can still be read for parity and migration verification, but not for target design decisions.
