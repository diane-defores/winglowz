# Suite Authentication Pointer

The canonical suite authentication decision lives in:

`/home/claude/shipflow_data/projects/winflowz/docs/technical/suite-authentication.md`

For this Android app:

- Firebase Auth remains the active app auth adapter for now.
- Clerk is the long-term suite identity provider.
- The app should bridge Firebase `uid` to the suite `global_user_id`.
- Product access must come from server-owned entitlements, not from account existence.
- Do not migrate this app directly to Clerk Flutter/native until that path is proven on Android device QA.
- The app now has domain contracts, a Riverpod suite identity provider, non-sensitive Settings diagnostics, and a bridge client behind `SUITE_IDENTITY_BRIDGE_URL`.
- If `SUITE_IDENTITY_BRIDGE_URL` is missing, invalid, unavailable, or returns an unexpected payload, the app stays fail-closed: Firebase sign-in is recognized locally but does not imply a `globalUserId` or product entitlement.
- Firestore product data under `users/{uid}` is gated by a server-owned `suiteAccess/{uid}` mirror. The app also refuses to select Firestore-backed product stores unless `suiteIdentityProvider` grants `winflowz_app`.
- The `suiteAccess/{uid}` mirror is not client-readable or client-writable. It is written by the suite bridge backend after Firebase Admin token verification and Convex entitlement lookup.
- The Formation Firebase bridge checks revoked/disabled Firebase sessions server-side. A structurally valid but revoked Firebase ID token must be rejected before Convex identity linking or Firestore mirror writes.
- Entitlement changes no longer depend only on the next app login bridge call: Formation now has an internal sync endpoint for Polar grant/refund/revoke events. Production still needs configured `SUITE_BRIDGE_SYNC_URL` proof before final ship.
- Support operators should use the canonical runbook at `/home/claude/shipflow_data/projects/winflowz/docs/technical/suite-authentication-support-runbook.md` for account-recognition, linking, entitlement and provider triage.
- Redacted smoke-readiness log: [shipflow_data/workflow/TEST_LOG.md](</home/claude/winflowz_app/shipflow_data/workflow/TEST_LOG.md>).

Implementation details belong in the active spec:
