# Technical Docs — WinFlowz

This internal layer maps code areas to the technical context an agent must read
before editing. It is not public product documentation.

## Current Coverage

- `docs/technical/flutter-app.md`: Flutter app shell, platform bridges, settings,
  and repository boundaries.
- `docs/technical/android-native.md`: Android native overlay and keyboard/IME
  services.
- `docs/technical/supabase-data.md`: legacy Supabase schema, RLS, repositories,
  and smoke tests from the previous target path.
- `docs/technical/firebase-cli-foundation.md`: Firebase CLI foundation, deployment
  and emulator commands, and GitHub/Blacksmith secret list.
- `docs/technical/firebase-oidc-ci-playbook.md`: step-by-step CI runbook for
  GitHub OIDC/WIF Firestore deploy, including troubleshooting from real failures.

## Maintenance Rule

Update `docs/technical/code-docs-map.md` and the relevant subsystem doc when
owned files, entrypoints, validation commands, security constraints, or docs
update triggers change.
