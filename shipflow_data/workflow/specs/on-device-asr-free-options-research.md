# Free On-Device ASR Options

## Position

WinFlowz should treat local/on-device ASR as the default keyboard dictation path. The server worker should be reserved for explicit high-quality fallback, not normal keyboard input.

The strongest first implementation candidate is `sherpa-onnx` as the runtime wrapper, because it already supports Android, Kotlin/Java, Dart, streaming and non-streaming ASR, VAD, Whisper exports, Moonshine exports, SenseVoice exports, and multiple model families behind one deployment shape.

## Shortlist

| Option | Fit for WinFlowz | License posture | Strength | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sherpa-onnx` | Best runtime candidate | Apache-2.0 code | Android, Kotlin/Java/Dart APIs, streaming/non-streaming, many model families | Model choice still needs benchmarking |
| Whisper via `sherpa-onnx` | Best French-capable baseline | Whisper is MIT; converted model license should be tracked | Multilingual, known quality, works with French | Tiny/base may be weak; small may be heavy |
| `whisper.cpp` | Strong fallback runtime | MIT | Mature C/C++ local Whisper, quantized models | Android IME integration and streaming UX may require more native work |
| Vosk | Best ultra-light fallback | Apache-2.0 for core and many models | Small French model around 41MB, low memory, proven Android path | Accuracy likely below Whisper/SenseVoice-class models |
| SenseVoice/FunASR | High-potential Chinese ecosystem | FunASR code MIT; model license needs legal review | Very fast, strong multilingual claims, ONNX export, sherpa integration | SenseVoice-Small does not cover French directly in listed core languages |
| Moonshine | Strong edge-device tech | English models MIT; non-English models community/commercial threshold license | Very small/fast models, Android examples | French availability/license not yet a clean fit |
| WeNet | Production ASR toolkit | Apache-2.0 | Mature, production-oriented, Chinese ecosystem | More toolkit than drop-in Android IME runtime |
| PaddleSpeech | Broad Baidu/Paddle toolkit | Apache-2.0 | ASR, TTS, punctuation, streaming server patterns | Mobile/IME embedding appears less direct than sherpa/whisper/Vosk |

## Recommended First Spike

1. Build a local ASR abstraction in native Android:
   `KeyboardVoiceEngine.start()`, `stop()`, `cancel()`, `state`, `result`.

2. Spike `sherpa-onnx` first with two model tracks:
   `whisper-base` or `whisper-small` multilingual for French/English quality, plus a tiny model for low-end devices.

3. Keep Vosk as the lightweight fallback:
   use `vosk-model-small-fr-0.22` for a low-storage French test and compare it directly against Whisper local.

4. Benchmark on real Android hardware:
   cold model load time, memory, battery feel, real-time factor, dictation quality in French, punctuation quality, and keyboard responsiveness.

5. Only after that, evaluate SenseVoice/FunASR:
   it is very promising, especially through sherpa-onnx, but its obvious small model coverage is Mandarin/Cantonese/English/Japanese/Korean rather than French.

## Why Not Android SpeechRecognizer As Default

Android exposes offline preference flags, but the platform documentation says recognizer behavior can depend on implementation and flags may have no effect. That makes it useful as fallback but weak as our default product promise.

## Evidence

- `sherpa-onnx` supports Android arm64/arm32, Kotlin/Java/Dart APIs, and both streaming and non-streaming speech-to-text.
- `sherpa-onnx` lists Android APKs and Android model examples for Whisper, Moonshine, SenseVoice, VAD, and other models.
- OpenAI Whisper is MIT and has multilingual models from tiny to large/turbo; model sizes range from 39M to 1550M parameters.
- `whisper.cpp` is MIT and provides local C/C++ Whisper inference.
- Vosk core is Apache-2.0; its model catalog includes `vosk-model-small-fr-0.22`, a 41MB French model for Android/iOS/Raspberry Pi, and an Apache-2.0 license for that model.
- FunASR code is MIT and includes ASR, VAD, punctuation restoration, and model deployment tooling; its models use a separate model license agreement that needs review before commercial shipping.
- SenseVoice advertises high-accuracy multilingual ASR and ONNX export, with third-party sherpa-onnx deployment on Android/iOS/Raspberry Pi.
- Moonshine code and English models are MIT, but non-English models use a community license with a commercial revenue threshold; French fit is not currently clear enough for default WinFlowz usage.
- WeNet and PaddleSpeech are Apache-2.0 production/toolkit options, but not the shortest path for an Android IME integration.

## Current Recommendation

Start with `sherpa-onnx + Whisper multilingual` for the first French-capable prototype. Add Vosk French as a tiny fallback benchmark. Keep SenseVoice/FunASR on the watchlist for future high-performance models, especially if we find or train a French-capable export that is legally clean for commercial distribution.

For a global LTD launch, this should become a free language-pack catalog rather than a paid marketplace. Packs should be install-on-demand by locale, because bundling every model would make the APK too large and would still disappoint users if quality varies by language. Each pack needs explicit language, engine, model, size, license, and quality tier metadata before it is marketed.
